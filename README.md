* Emacs python ready environment

This repo holds my configuration for emacs, it uses mostly elpy, magit
and a few keybindings for python development.

The file is under test.

* Emacs installation

> brew install emacs

* Configuration installation

Simply clone this repo wherever you want and make a soft link in your
home directory to the .emacs file.

Then run emacs and enjoy.
